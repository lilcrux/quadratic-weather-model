# Quadratic Weather Model

This project demonstrates solving quadratic equations in **Java** across multiple stages. It is a simple simulation to understand how weather modeling or any data model can be built progressively.

## 👨‍🔬 Project Stages

### ✅ Stage 1: Hardcoded Values
- Coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are directly written in the code.
- Calculates roots using the quadratic formula.

### ✅ Stage 2: Keyboard Input
- Takes `a`, `b`, and `c` values from the user through the keyboard.

### ✅ Stage 3: Single Input from File
- Reads one line from `input.txt` for `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Computes and prints roots.

### ✅ Stage 4: Multiple Inputs from File
- Reads multiple lines from `input.txt`, each containing `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Loops through each and prints results.
